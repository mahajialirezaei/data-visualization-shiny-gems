# Data Visualization with Seaborn - Shiny Gems

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging **Seaborn**, a powerful visualization library in Python, to create insightful, visually appealing charts and graphs from real-world data. The primary goal of this repository is to showcase various visualizations that help in exploring and understanding datasets. The project utilizes **Jupyter Notebooks** to create interactive, easy-to-follow notebooks for reproducible data analysis.

The datasets used in this project focus on showcasing the power of Seaborn for:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visual comparisons of distributions
- Understanding correlations between different variables
- Creating informative charts with minimal code

This repository contains a series of notebooks demonstrating various types of visualizations including bar plots, heatmaps, pair plots, and more.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **notebooks/**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various data visualizations and exploratory data analysis techniques.
- **data/**: Contains datasets used for visualization. You can replace or add your own dataset here to generate additional visualizations.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview and detailed instructions for the project.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For creating a wide range of statistical plots.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling.
- **Matplotlib**: Used alongside Seaborn for fine-tuning visualizations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **SciPy**: For statistical calculations (if needed).

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps to set up your environment:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahajialirezaei/data-visualization-shiny-gems.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can install the required libraries using `pip` by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Here’s the content of `requirements.txt`:

```text
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
jupyter
numpy
scipy
```

Alternatively, you can manually install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib jupyter numpy scipy
```

### 3. Launch Jupyter Notebook

Once the dependencies are installed, you can launch Jupyter Notebook from the command line:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `.ipynb` files in the `notebooks/` directory to start exploring the visualizations.

## Datasets

In this project, we work with different datasets that demonstrate the capabilities of Seaborn. You can find sample data files in the `data/` directory, such as `gems_data.csv`.

Feel free to replace or add your own dataset to create new visualizations.

### Example Data: `gems_data.csv`
- This dataset contains information about various types of gems, including features like weight, color, price, and rarity.
  
```csv
id,name,weight,color,price,rarity
1,Emerald,1.5,Green,500,High
2,Ruby,0.8,Red,350,Medium
3,Sapphire,1.2,Blue,400,Medium
4,Diamond,1.8,Colorless,1000,High
5,Opal,0.6,Multicolor,200,Low
```

## Visualizations

This repository includes a series of visualizations, each focusing on a different aspect of the dataset. The types of visualizations include:

- **Distribution Plots**: Visualize the distribution of variables such as the weight and price of gems.
- **Heatmaps**: Show correlations between different numerical features.
- **Pair Plots**: Display relationships between multiple features in a dataset.
- **Bar Plots**: Compare the frequency or count of categorical variables.
- **Box Plots**: Visualize the distribution and outliers of continuous variables.
  
### Example:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
gems = pd.read_csv('data/gems_data.csv')

# Distribution plot of 'weight'
sns.histplot(gems['weight'], kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Gem Weights')
plt.show()
```
